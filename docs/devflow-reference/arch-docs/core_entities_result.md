Based on the repository structure and the nature of the project ("DevFlow" with a strong emphasis on Agents, AI providers, and Git operations), here is an analysis of the common data entities and domain models.

The project appears to be a **Developer Productivity Platform** powered by AI Agents. It manages the lifecycle of software projects by orchestrating various AI agents to handle code generation, git management, and dependency resolution.

### 1. Common Data Entities / Domain Models

#### **Agent**
*   **Description:** Represents an AI entity capable of performing specific tasks (e.g., fixing code, generating PRs, managing context).
*   **Key Attributes/Fields:**
    *   `id`: Unique identifier (e.g., `fix-agent`, `pr-generator`).
    *   `name`: Display name.
    *   `type`: Category of agent (e.g., specialized, orchestrator).
    *   `config`: Configuration specific to the agent's prompt or behavior system.
    *   `status`: Current state (idle, busy, error).
    *   `capabilities`: List of skills or permissions the agent possesses.

#### **Provider (LLM)**
*   **Description:** Represents the AI model provider (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic) and specific model configurations available to the system.
*   **Key Attributes/Fields:**
    *   `providerName`: The service provider (e.g., `openai`, `anthropic`).
    *   `modelName`: The specific model (e.g., `gpt-4`, `claude-3-opus`).
    *   `apiKey` / `authDetails`: Authentication credentials (stored securely).
    *   `baseURL`: Endpoint URL.
    *   `settings`: Parameters like temperature, max tokens, context window size.

#### **Project**
*   **Description:** A logical grouping representing a software project being managed by DevFlow.
*   **Key Attributes/Fields:**
    *   `path`: File system path to the project root.
    *   `name`: Project name.
    *   `context`: The relevant files, docs, and metadata associated with the project for AI consumption.
    *   `branch`: The active git branch context.

#### **Task / Execution**
*   **Description:** A unit of work assigned to an Agent (e.g., "Fix authentication bug").
*   **Key Attributes/Fields:**
    *   `taskId`: Unique execution ID.
    *   `agentId`: The agent assigned to the task.
    *   `prompt`: The user input or system trigger initiating the task.
    *   `status`: Queued, Running, Completed, Failed.
    *   `logs`: Stream of output or thoughts from the agent.
    *   `artifacts`: Generated files or changes resulting from the task.

#### **GitEntity / PullRequest (PR)**
*   **Description:** Represents the version control state, specifically Pull Requests generated by the system.
*   **Key Attributes/Fields:**
    *   `prNumber`: ID of the PR.
    *   `title`: Title of the PR.
    *   `description`: Body content/description.
    *   `sourceBranch`: Feature branch.
    *   `targetBranch`: Base branch (e.g., `main`).
    *   `diff`: Changeset associated with the PR.
    *   `reviewStatus`: Feedback state from CI/CD or human review.

#### **Dependency / Package**
*   **Description:** Represents a software library or package managed by the dependency resolver.
*   **Key Attributes/Fields:**
    *   `name`: Package name.
    *   `version`: Semantic version.
    *   `type`: Dependency type (dev, prod, peer).
    *   `resolvedUrl`: The URL where the package is hosted.

#### **User / Profile**
*   **Description:** Represents the user interacting with the UI and their specific preferences.
*   **Key Attributes/Fields:**
    *   `userId`: Unique identifier.
    *   `settings`: UI preferences (themes, layout).
    *   `apiKeys`: Personal API tokens for external providers (if local).
    *   `history`: Past interactions or executed commands.

### 2. Relationships

**Agent ↔ Provider (Many-to-One)**
*   **Description:** Multiple Agents can utilize the same LLM Provider/Model, or specific Agents might be configured to use specific Providers (e.g., a "Fast Agent" uses a cheaper/faster model, while a "Reasoning Agent" uses a smarter/slower model).

**Project ↔ Task (One-to-Many)**
*   **Description:** A single Project (repository) context is required to execute many Tasks (code changes, fixes). Tasks are generated *within* the scope of a Project.

**Agent ↔ Task (Many-to-Many)**
*   **Description:** While a specific task instance is executed by one agent, the definition of which agent handles which type of task is dynamic. A "Fix" task goes to the "Fix Agent", a "PR" task goes to the "PR Agent".

**Task ↔ GitEntity (One-to-One / One-to-Many)**
*   **Description:** A Task often results in a Git change. A single Task might produce one Commit, or it might produce a full Pull Request (which contains a branch and potentially multiple commits).

**Profile ↔ Agent (One-to-Many)**
*   **Description:** A User Profile may have custom configurations or specific instances of Agents (e.g., "My Claude Agent" vs "My GPT Agent") tailored to their preferences.

**Project ↔ Dependency (Many-to-Many)**
*   **Description:** A Project contains multiple Dependencies, and a library (Dependency) can be used across multiple different Projects managed by the tool.
